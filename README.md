# Fraction Library

A simple yet powerful Python library that provides a `Fraction` class for performing
**exact arithmetic on rational numbers** using **operator overloading** and
**method chaining**.

This library is designed for learning and practice, and demonstrates clean
object-oriented design, Python magic methods, automatic simplification, and
real-world library behavior.

## ✨ Features

- Supports fraction addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Method chaining support for complex expressions
- Automatic fraction simplification using `math.gcd()`
- Uses Python magic methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)
- Seamless operations with integers (`Fraction + int`, `int + Fraction`)
- Conversion utilities:
  - Fraction to decimal
  - Float to fraction
- Safe error handling for zero denominators and division by zero
- Beginner-friendly, clean, and readable code
- Suitable for academic use, interviews, and Python practice
